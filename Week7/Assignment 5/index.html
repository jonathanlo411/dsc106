        You recently moved to Mars. You are a part of a team that is responsible for setting up a new civilization there. You have been assigned the responsibility of creating a sporting event that will unite the population of Mars. You decide to take inspiration from the 500 years old event from Earth - Olympics. But the Olympics did not start with all the sports that it has today, and you need to follow a similar pattern to select games that will be played at the first edition of the Olympics on mars.
        <br>
        You are supposed to present an analysis to your team on how the Olympics on Mars can be an improved version of the Olympics on Earth. For this, we will create a visualization in every question given below that will help us create a presentation for a better Olympics.
